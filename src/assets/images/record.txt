Ronaldo memorabilia at Sporting CP's museum
At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with<br>
 his dribbling.[22] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams,<br>
  the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[17] A year later, on 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against <br>
  Braga and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3-0 win.[23] Over the course of the 2002-03 season, his representatives suggested the<br> player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[24] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer.[25]

Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, <br>after Sporting defeated United  at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[26] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million[26] for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.[27] A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.[28]
